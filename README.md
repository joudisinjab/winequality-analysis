# Wine Quality Analysis and Classification

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Wine Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Two datasets containing physiochemical and sensory variables related to red and white wine variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. This assignment was completed as part of the Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics Certificate.

## Assignment Overview

This project explores the quality of Portuguese wines (red and white). Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and classification models, the project aims to predict wine quality and evaluate the models' effectiveness. Techniques such as data merging, normalization, logistic regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were used to uncover insights and enhance prediction accuracy.

### Tasks

The following tasks were completed in this assignment, with code answering each of the questions provided:

1. Merge red and white wine datasets into a single dataset.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand dataset characteristics and correlations.
3. Preprocess data by normalizing numeric attributes and categorizing quality levels.
4. Train classification models (Logistic Regression and KNN) to predict wine quality.
5. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
